![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
The challenge was to make the website as close as possible to the given design.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## Technologies I used to build the project

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JS
- Swiper JS

# Usage

Install dependencies (Tailwind)

```
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the **src/input.css** during development. The output file is **css/main.css**

```
npm run watch
```

To build once run...

```
npm run build
```

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
